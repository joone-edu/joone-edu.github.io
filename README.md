Our mission is to provide an accessible and robust framework for compliance with private educational standards, ensuring every family has the support they need for a successful home education journey. Embracing our commitment to community and accessibility, we utilize Gibbon, an open-source Student Information System (SIS), which integrates seamlessly with Canvas LMS. This integration facilitates a well-organized and unified educational experience. With Joone, you have a dependable ally in providing flexible and structured education, true to the ethos of open-source and community-driven innovation.

Joone is versatile, supporting various educational approaches including alternative philosophies like Montessori and Unschooling, curriculum-based methods like AP and STEM, and environment-focused learning such as Forest Schooling. It accommodates community-based and specialized programs, student-centered learning, and technology-enhanced methods, making it a comprehensive tool for diverse educational needs.

Joone, as a non-profit, equips families with essential tools and connects them to established educational communities. We cater to a diverse range of learners, fostering environments where innovation and creativity thrive. Our focus is on practical support, ensuring each child's unique educational path is well-resourced and guided by community expertise.
